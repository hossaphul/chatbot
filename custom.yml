conversations:
- - My graduate application has been completed. What am I suppose to do next? Will I be notified about acceptance or next step required?
  - Once your file is complete it will be processed within 2-3 business days (please allow more time during peak registration periods). If your GPA meets the requirements, your file will be forwarded to the department for review and the decision. You will then receive the official admissions letter by mail. If admitted, you will be able to register during the regular registration period through the MyUNT portal page.
- - I would like to take one graduate course at UNT. Do I have to apply to the graduate school?
  - Yes, you will need to apply for admission through the Graduate School. You will need to submit an application, pay the fee and submit all official transcripts from schools attended. Since you only want to take one course, you can apply as a non-degree seeking student. This will allow you admission based solely on your GPA. If you need financial aid, please contact their office before applying to this status to discuss your eligibility.
- - I would like to reactivate my graduate studies at the University of North Texas.
  - If you were previously admitted to a graduate program and have not been enrolled in over one academic year, you will need to reapply. Reapply online here!
- - How do I know that my application has been received?
  - If you received an auto-reply that led you to the FAQ’s after you clicked “submit”, your application HAS been received.
- - What do I do if I owe fees for a thesis or dissertation?
  - You can go to the Student Accounting windows on the first floor of the Eagle Student Services Center, M-F, 8:15 am – 4:45 pm and have them posted to your student account so you can pay them. Alternately, you can wait to receive an email from the Graduation Office alerting you that they have been posted to your account and need to be paid. It may take 10-14 days after you submit your final paper for this email to arrive since entry/posting is a manual process that has to be done for each paper that is received.
- - When will I receive my diploma?
  - Diplomas are mailed approximately 8 weeks after graduation and are sent directly by our vendor to the mailing address you have on file in MyUNT; it is your responsibility to update this if you relocate after commencement.
- - Who are you?
  - I am just an artificial intelligence.
